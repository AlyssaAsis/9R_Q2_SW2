			 	</td>
			 	<td>Happiest when at home, the Persian cat is neither needy nor aloof, but a mixture of quiet affection and calm independence. Persians tend to be fairly quiet, but when they vocalize, they have sweet, musical voices. They love to cuddle or hang out next to you, and will happily greet you at the door when you come home.</td>

			 </a>
			 	</td>
			 	<td>The Siberianâ€™s head is wedge-shaped with soft contours, topped by medium to large tufted ears. Their nearly round eyes range from shades of green to gold to copper, though white Siberians or those with white markings or patches may have blue eyes or eyes of different colors. Strong-boned legs and round, tufted paws support their muscular body and long, thick tail.</td>

					<h1>Birman Cat</h1>
			<a href="https://www.hillspet.com/cat-care/cat-breeds/birman">
				<img src="birman.img" width="200" height="200"></a>
				</td>
				<td>The Birman has very unusual markings. She looks like a pointed cat with four white feet (mitted) and deep blue eyes. The head is actually triangular, but the Birman has such a broad skull that the face can appear almost rounded. The Birman has a Roman nose and medium-sized ears.</td>
